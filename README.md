Used Car Price Prediction Competition
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Used Car Price Prediction Competition." The competition aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset for this competition is provided in two parts:

- Train Dataset: This dataset contains a set of used car records with various features, along with their corresponding price values, which serve as the target variable for prediction.
- Test Dataset: The test dataset consists of a similar set of used car records, but without the corresponding price values. Participants are required to predict the prices for these test records based on the trained models.

Additional Notes

- The dataset provided for this competition was generated from a deep learning model fine-tuned on the "Used Car Price Prediction Dataset" dataset. The feature distributions are similar but not exactly the same as the original dataset.
- Participants have the option to incorporate the original dataset into their training process, but it is not mandatory for the competition.
- The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Feel free to explore the differences between the generated dataset and the original dataset to gain insights into the impact on model performance.
